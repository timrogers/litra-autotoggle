## Usage

### In the background, using Homebrew Services ([Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installations only)

Run `brew services start timrogers/tap/litra-autotoggle`.

`litra-autotoggle` will run in the background, and your Litra will turn on when your webcam turns on, and off when your webcam turns off. If no Litra device is connected, the listener will keep on running, but will do nothing.

> [!NOTE]
> When starting the service for the first time on a macOS device, you will receive a notification warning you about software running in the background.

### From the command line

Just run `litra-autotoggle`. Your Litra(s) will turn on when your webcam turns on, and off when your webcam turns off.

The following optional arguments are supported:

- `--serial-number` or `--device-path` to point to a specific Litra device. You can get the serial number using the `litra devices` command in the [`litra`](https://github.com/timrogers/litra-rs) CLI.
- `--device-type` to select one or more devices based on the time (`glow`, `beam` or `beam-lx`)
- `--require-device` to enforce that a Litra device must be connected. By default, the listener will keep running even if no Litra device is found. With this set, the listener will exit whenever it looks for a Litra device and none is found.
- `--video-device` (Linux only) to watch a specific video device (e.g. `/dev/video0`). By default, all video devices will be watched.
- `--delay` to customize the delay (in milliseconds) between a webcam event being detected and toggling your Litra. When your webcam turns on or off, multiple events may be generated in quick succession. Setting a delay allows the program to wait for all events before taking action, avoiding flickering. Defaults to 1.5 seconds (1500 milliseconds).

## Configuring `udev` permissions (Linux only)

On most Linux operating systems, you will need to manually configure permissions using [`udev`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/udev.7.html) to allow non-`root` users to access and manage Litra devices.

To allow all users that are part of the `video` group to access the Litra devices, copy the [`99-litra.rules`](99-litra.rules) file into `/etc/udev/rules.d`.

Next, reboot your computer or run the following commands as `root`:

    # udevadm control --reload-rules
    # udevadm trigger
