# * INTRODUCTION *
# ----------------
# You can configure litra-autotoggle by specifying command line arguments directly
# (e.g. `--device-type glow`), or you can use a YML configuration file like this one
# and pass its path in the `--config-file` argument.
#
# The Homebrew service, started with `brew services start litra-autotoggle`,
# automatically uses a config file located at `$(brew --prefix)/etc/litra-autotoggle.yml`.
#
